## Frontend project boilerplate ##

Just a simple little project to set up a workable site easily. Includes grunt for jshint, requirejs compilation and sass compilation, also a small one-line webserver, and a shell script to create a new boilerplate and remove the guff that isn't necessary (namely this readme, the shell script itself, whatever).

Just shove the newboilerplate.sh script in /usr/local/bin and run it with

    newboilerplate folder

and it'll clone this repo, shove it in the folder given and delete the meta crap that doesn't need to be there.

Job's a good'un.
